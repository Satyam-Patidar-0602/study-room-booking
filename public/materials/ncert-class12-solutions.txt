PHYSICS SOLUTIONS
-----------------

Chapter 1: Electric Charges and Fields
Q1. What is the force between two small charged spheres having charges of 2 × 10^–7C and 3 × 10^–7C placed 30 cm apart in air?
Solution: Using Coulomb's law, F = k(q1q2)/r²
F = 9×10^9 × (2×10^-7 × 3×10^-7) / (0.3)²
F = 6×10^-3 N

Chapter 2: Electrostatic Potential and Capacitance
Q1. A 600 pF capacitor is charged by a 200 V supply. It is then disconnected from the supply and is connected to another uncharged 600 pF capacitor. How much electrostatic energy is lost in the process?
Solution: Initial energy = ½CV² = ½ × 600×10^-12 × (200)² = 12×10^-6 J
Final energy = ½ × 1200×10^-12 × (100)² = 6×10^-6 J
Energy lost = 6×10^-6 J

CHEMISTRY SOLUTIONS

Chapter 1: The Solid State
Q1. Define the term 'amorphous'. Give a few examples of amorphous solids.
Solution: Amorphous solids are those in which the constituent particles are not arranged in a regular manner. Examples: glass, rubber, plastic.

Chapter 2: Solutions
Q1. Calculate the mass percentage of benzene (C6H6) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) if 22 g of benzene is dissolved in 122 g of carbon tetrachloride.
Solution: Mass percentage of benzene = (22/144) × 100 = 15.28%
Mass percentage of CCl4 = (122/144) × 100 = 84.72%

MATHEMATICS SOLUTIONS

Chapter 1: Relations and Functions
Q1. Show that the relation R in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} given by R = {(a, b) : |a – b| is even}, is an equivalence relation.
Solution: 
(i) Reflexive: |a – a| = 0 is even for all a ∈ A
(ii) Symmetric: If |a – b| is even, then |b – a| is also even
(iii) Transitive: If |a – b| and |b – c| are even, then |a – c| is even
Hence R is an equivalence relation.

Chapter 2: Inverse Trigonometric Functions
Q1. Find the principal value of sin^-1(-1/2)
Solution: sin^-1(-1/2) = -π/6 (principal value)
