SSC QUANTITATIVE APTITUDE GUIDE
===============================

NUMBER SYSTEM
=============

1. TYPES OF NUMBERS
- Natural Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
- Whole Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
- Integers: ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
- Rational Numbers: Numbers that can be expressed as p/q
- Irrational Numbers: Numbers that cannot be expressed as p/q
- Real Numbers: All rational and irrational numbers

2. DIVISIBILITY RULES
- Divisible by 2: Last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
- Divisible by 3: Sum of digits is divisible by 3
- Divisible by 4: Last two digits form a number divisible by 4
- Divisible by 5: Last digit is 0 or 5
- Divisible by 6: Divisible by both 2 and 3
- Divisible by 8: Last three digits form a number divisible by 8
- Divisible by 9: Sum of digits is divisible by 9
- Divisible by 10: Last digit is 0
- Divisible by 11: Difference between sum of digits at odd and even places is 0 or divisible by 11

PERCENTAGE
==========

1. BASIC CONCEPTS
- Percentage = (Value/Total) × 100
- Value = (Percentage × Total)/100
- Total = (Value × 100)/Percentage

2. IMPORTANT FORMULAS
- If A is x% more than B, then B is [x/(100+x)] × 100% less than A
- If A is x% less than B, then B is [x/(100-x)] × 100% more than A
- Successive percentage change: a% + b% + (a×b)/100%

PROFIT AND LOSS
===============

1. BASIC FORMULAS
- Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
- Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price
- Profit % = (Profit/Cost Price) × 100
- Loss % = (Loss/Cost Price) × 100
- Selling Price = Cost Price × (100 + Profit%)/100
- Selling Price = Cost Price × (100 - Loss%)/100

2. DISCOUNT
- Discount = Marked Price - Selling Price
- Discount % = (Discount/Marked Price) × 100
- Selling Price = Marked Price × (100 - Discount%)/100

SIMPLE AND COMPOUND INTEREST
============================

1. SIMPLE INTEREST
- SI = (P × R × T)/100
- Amount = P + SI
- Where P = Principal, R = Rate, T = Time

2. COMPOUND INTEREST
- Amount = P(1 + R/100)^T
- CI = Amount - Principal
- For half-yearly: R/2 and T×2
- For quarterly: R/4 and T×4

TIME AND WORK
=============

1. BASIC CONCEPTS
- If A can do a work in x days, then A's 1 day work = 1/x
- If A and B can do a work in x and y days respectively, then together they can do it in xy/(x+y) days

2. EFFICIENCY
- If A is twice as efficient as B, then A takes half the time B takes
- If A and B can do a work in x and y days, and A is n times more efficient than B, then x = y/n

TIME AND DISTANCE
=================

1. BASIC FORMULAS
- Speed = Distance/Time
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Time = Distance/Speed

2. RELATIVE SPEED
- When moving in same direction: Relative speed = Speed1 - Speed2
- When moving in opposite direction: Relative speed = Speed1 + Speed2

3. TRAINS
- Time taken to cross a pole = Length of train/Speed
- Time taken to cross a platform = (Length of train + Length of platform)/Speed

MIXTURE AND ALLIGATION
======================

1. BASIC CONCEPT
- Alligation is a rule that enables us to find the ratio in which two or more ingredients at the given price must be mixed to produce a mixture of desired price.

2. FORMULA
- (Cheaper quantity)/(Dearer quantity) = (d - m)/(m - c)
- Where d = dearer price, c = cheaper price, m = mean price

AVERAGE
========

1. BASIC FORMULA
- Average = Sum of observations/Number of observations

2. WEIGHTED AVERAGE
- Weighted Average = (w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + wnxn)/(w1 + w2 + ... + wn)

RATIO AND PROPORTION
====================

1. RATIO
- Ratio of a to b is written as a:b
- If a:b = c:d, then a×d = b×c

2. PROPORTION
- If a:b = c:d, then a, b, c, d are in proportion
- Product of extremes = Product of means

SAMPLE QUESTIONS
================

(a) 0 (b) 1 (c) 2 (d) 3

Q4. The simple interest on a sum of money for 2 years at 8% per annum is Rs. 240. The compound interest on the same sum for the same period at the same rate is:
(a) Rs. 249.60 (b) Rs. 250 (c) Rs. 251.20 (d) Rs. 252
Answer: (a) Rs. 249.60

(a) 5 days (b) 6 days (c) 7 days (d) 8 days
Answer: (b) 6 days
